# Summary

*UPDATE 17.06.2018*
- I've added version of this test with no text to "files" section, hope this helps!

!CHECKOUT NEWEST AND MORE COMPACT AIO 3D PRINTER TEST HERE :
https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2975429 !

After my latest design (All In One 3D printer test) got really popular, I've decided to make new, better, smaller and more detailed design.

I've literally started again from scratch, with few things in head - make it smaller, more detailed, and low on material. I think that I've done pretty good job!

!PRINT THIS WITHOUT SUPPORTS AND WITH 100% INFILL!

I hope that you'll like this design, don't forget to share your own 3D printout!

As always, feel free to tip me :-).
