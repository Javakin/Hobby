!UPDATE! (25.02.2018 1:28 CZ time)
- I was notified (big thanks to Craven112) about one small issue with my 3D design so I decided to fix it! The issue was "0.5mm diameter" text, which was meant to be "1.0mm diameter" text. Also, the hole test got a little mistake, the "8mm" hole was actually 9 mm in the diameter. Now everything should be fixed in "3D printer test fixed (3nd gen).stl" file. 

- I've also changed rotation of the model, so now it should be in the correct position :-).

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I decided to design All In One 3D Printer test, so here it is. This test includes : support test, scale test, overhang test, hole test, diameter test and bridging test. Print this with 100% Infill without supports.

!NOTE! : If you are using Cura and you are experiencing missing text issue, be sure to enable "use thin wall" setting! (big thanks to CoreyNach for this!)
